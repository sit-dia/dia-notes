# DIA Notes

These are mainly post-class notes from the SIT Developing Immersive Applications module.

## Course Overview
Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and other eXtended Reality (XR) or immersive applications are increasingly becoming important mediums for interacting with the digital realm. This course provides a practice-based introduction to the concepts and techniques to develop and evaluate immersive applications. Topics covered include implementation techniques for interaction, locomotion and the creation of virtual environments. By the end of this module, students will be proficient in explaining, implementing, and evaluating the core components of immersive applications.

## Learning Objectives
After successfully completing this module, students will be able to:

1. Explain typical hardware and software components that exist in immersive applications.
2. Design and implement software components related to immersive applications.
3. Evaluate key aspects of immersive user experiences.
